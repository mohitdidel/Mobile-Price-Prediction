# mobile-price-prediction
This project aims to predict the price of mobile phones using machine learning. It uses a dataset of mobile phone specifications, including brand, RAM, ROM, camera, battery, and processor, to train a Decision Tree Regressor model.
**Key Features:**
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training and evaluation
* Price prediction for new mobile phones
**How to use:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `mobile_price_prediction.ipynb`.
4. Enter the specifications of the mobile phone you want to predict the price for.
5. The predicted price will be displayed.
**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project is `mobile_prices_2023.csv`. It contains information about various mobile phones, including their specifications and prices.
**Model:**
The model used in this project is a Decision Tree Regressor. It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a decision tree to predict the target variable.
**Evaluation:**
The model's performance is evaluated using the R-squared metric. The R-squared value of the model is high, indicating that it is a good predictor of mobile phone prices.
